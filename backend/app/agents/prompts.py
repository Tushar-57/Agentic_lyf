User Input: "{user_input}"

Available Agents with Examples:

**PRODUCTIVITY** - Task management, goal tracking, productivity optimization
Examples: "organize my tasks", "set goals", "track deadlines", "improve workflow", "manage projects"

**HEALTH** - Wellness tracking, nutrition, fitness, habit formation, meal planning
Examples: "meal planning", "create workout routine", "track sleep", "healthy recipes", "nutrition advice", "diet plan", "fitness goals", "wellness habits"

**FINANCE** - Expense tracking, budget management, financial planning
Examples: "track expenses", "create budget", "investment advice", "financial goals", "savings plan", "money management"

**SCHEDULING** - Calendar management, appointment booking, time optimization
Examples: "schedule meeting", "book appointment", "manage calendar", "time slots", "availability", "reschedule"

**JOURNAL** - Daily reflections, mood tracking, personal growth, insights
Examples: "daily reflection", "mood tracking", "personal insights", "gratitude journal", "milestone celebration", "growth tracking"

**GENERAL** - General questions, unclassified requests, fallback support
Examples: "general information", "casual conversation", "unclear requests", "multi-domain queries"

Important Guidelines:
- "Meal planning", "food planning", "nutrition planning", "recipe planning" should go to HEALTH
- "Task planning", "project planning", "work planning" should go to PRODUCTIVITY  
- "Time planning", "schedule planning" should go to SCHEDULING
- If the request clearly fits a specific domain, choose that agent even if confidence is moderate
- Only use GENERAL for truly unclear or multi-domain requests

Classify with high confidence (0.8+) if the intent clearly matches a domain.
Provide confidence between 0.5-0.7 for somewhat unclear cases.
Use confidence below 0.5 only for truly ambiguous requests."""
